BD DAMP STOP X
A Low viscosity, highly penetrating silane, silanol – siloxane solution
Available Package Size	Rate
5	
25	
Coverage Area
Depending upon penetration and porosity

Features
icon Penetrates deeply into brick and other masonry substrates.
icon Form a durable polysiloxane damp course via chemical bonding.
icon Easy to use, non-corrosive and non-toxic formulation.

Area of Application
BD DAMP STOP X is used to install a durable polymer damp course into brickwork or other masonry walls to permanently stop rising dampness. 
Rising damp is a major cause of decay in masonry materials such as stone, brick and mortar. Even when mild it can cause unsightly crumbling of exterior masonry/concrete and staining of internal finish. 
When severe it is a potential health hazard to building occupants due to high humidity levels and the growth of molds. 
When coupled with high salt concentrations, severe dampness can cause extensive fretting and crumbling of the lower parts of walls, requiring difficult and expensive repairs

Description
BD DAMP STOP X is a low-viscosity, highly penetrating silane, silanol-siloxane solution, which has been specifically formulated to permeate into walls affected by rising dampness. Rising dampness in buildings may be defined as the vertical
flow of water up through a permeable wall structure, the water is derived from
groundwater. Once impregnated into a course of brickwork, BD DAMP STOP X
reacts with minerals present to form a durable polymer damp course, which
permanently stops rising damp.
