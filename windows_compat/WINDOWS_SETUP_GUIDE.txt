BUILDING DOCTOR WEBSITE - WINDOWS SETUP GUIDE
=============================================

If you're having trouble running this application on Windows, especially with Node.js v18,
follow this comprehensive guide to get it working.

----------------------------------
COMMON ERRORS YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER:
----------------------------------

1. "The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined"
2. "Error: ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME"
3. "Error: Cannot find module 'path/import.meta'"
4. "ReferenceError: import is not defined"

These errors are common when using Node.js v18 on Windows with Vite/ESM projects.

-------------------------
SOLUTION 1: RECOMMENDED
-------------------------

1. Generate the Windows-compatible batch file:
   - Run this command: node create-batch-file.js
   - This will create a file called "start-windows-legacy.bat"

2. Run the batch file:
   - Double-click on "start-windows-legacy.bat"
   - Or run it from command prompt: start-windows-legacy.bat

This approach uses a simplified CommonJS configuration file that works better on Windows.

-------------------------
SOLUTION 2: DIRECT METHOD
-------------------------

If you prefer not to use the batch file, you can:

1. Run: node start-windows-simple.js

This script does the same thing - it creates a temporary Windows-compatible
configuration file and starts the application.

-------------------------
SOLUTION 3: MINIMAL METHOD
-------------------------

If you're still having problems:

1. Run: node start-windows-minimal.js

This is the most bare-bones approach and should work on even the most
problematic Windows systems.

--------------------------
SOLUTION 4: UPGRADE NODE.JS
--------------------------

The best solution is to upgrade to Node.js v20, which has much better ESM support:

1. Download Node.js v20 from: https://nodejs.org/
2. Install it (you may need to uninstall your current version first)
3. Restart your computer
4. Run the standard command: npm run dev

-----------------------
ADDITIONAL TIPS
-----------------------

1. PROJECT PATH: Avoid spaces in your project path
   - Bad: "C:\My Projects\Building Doctor\"
   - Good: "C:\Projects\BuildingDoctor\"

2. DEPENDENCIES: Make sure all dependencies are installed
   - Run: npm install
   - If you see errors about missing packages

3. ENVIRONMENT: Make sure you're using Node.js v18.18.1 or higher
   - Run: node -v
   - If it's lower than v18.18.1, please upgrade

4. PERMISSION ISSUES: Run as administrator if needed
   - Right-click on Command Prompt or PowerShell and select "Run as administrator"

-----------------------
TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------------

The root issue is that Node.js v18 on Windows has limitations with:
1. ESM (ECMAScript Modules) URL scheme handling
2. Path resolution, especially with spaces in paths
3. The import.meta features which are fully supported in Node.js v20

Our solution temporarily replaces the ESM Vite configuration with a CommonJS
version that's more compatible with Node.js v18 on Windows.

If you continue to have problems, please contact technical support.
