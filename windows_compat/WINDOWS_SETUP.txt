# Running the Building Doctor Website on Windows

If you're experiencing issues running this project on Windows, especially with errors like `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME` or `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` with Node.js v18, follow these steps:

## IMPORTANT UPDATE FOR NODE.JS V18 USERS

We've created a special compatibility solution for Windows users running Node.js v18.18.1. This new approach should fix the "paths[0]" error and other ESM-related issues.

## SOLUTION 1: USE THE WINDOWS COMPATIBILITY SCRIPT (RECOMMENDED)

1. Open your command prompt (cmd) or PowerShell window
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the following command:
   
   node start-windows.cjs
   

This script will:
- Temporarily set up a Windows-compatible Vite configuration
- Run the application with the right environment settings
- Restore the original configuration when done

## SOLUTION 2: INSTALL NODE.JS VERSION 20 (BEST OPTION)

For the smoothest experience, we recommend upgrading to Node.js v20 which has better ESM support:

1. Download Node.js v20.x from: https://nodejs.org/
2. Install it on your system
3. Restart your computer
4. Run the application using the standard npm command:
   
   npm run dev
   

## SOLUTION 3: MOVE PROJECT TO A DIRECTORY WITHOUT SPACES

Some errors occur when your project is in a directory path containing spaces. For example:
F:\Godiva Tech Soft Madurai\Building doctors\BuildingDoctorPro

Consider moving the project to a location without spaces in the path, such as:
F:\Projects\BuildingDoctorPro

## TECHNICAL EXPLANATION

The core issue is that Node.js v18 has limitations with:
1. ESM (ECMAScript Modules) URL scheme handling on Windows
2. Path resolution with spaces or special characters
3. The `import.meta.dirname` property which is only available in Node.js v20+

Our compatibility script works around these issues by using alternative path resolution methods and a modified Vite configuration file that is compatible with Node.js v18.
